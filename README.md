# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Purpose of this website

This website is intended to be used by the esports organization at Pitt, specifically the valorant team.  I created this so we could look further into our preformance metrics to analyze how we can improve.  It will hopefully use Riot Games' own API to obtain the statistics and information that is used for analysis.
